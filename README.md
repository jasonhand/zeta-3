# Œ∂(3) - Ap√©ry's Constant Interactive Visualization

An interactive web application that explores Œ∂(3), also known as Ap√©ry's constant, one of the most mysterious and intriguing mathematical constants. This project provides real-time visualizations of the infinite series that converges to Œ∂(3), along with educational content about its mathematical significance and the open questions surrounding it.

## What is Œ∂(3)?

Œ∂(3) is the value of the Riemann zeta function at 3, defined by the infinite series:

```
Œ∂(3) = 1 + 1/2¬≥ + 1/3¬≥ + 1/4¬≥ + 1/5¬≥ + ... = 1.2020569031595942854...
```

This constant is approximately 1.202056903... and represents one of the most fascinating unsolved problems in mathematics. While we know its value with incredible precision, we still don't know whether it's algebraic (a solution to a polynomial equation) or transcendental (like œÄ and e).

## Features

## How It Works

### Technical Implementation

The application is built as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript:

1. **Canvas-based Visualizations**: Uses HTML5 Canvas for real-time drawing of convergence curves and bar charts
2. **Animation Loop**: Implements `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth 60fps animations
3. **Real-time Computation**: Calculates partial sums on-the-fly as terms are added
4. **Interactive Controls**: Sliders and dropdowns that immediately affect the visualization
5. **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts

### Mathematical Algorithm

The core algorithm computes the partial sums of the infinite series:

```javascript
// For each term n from 1 to maxTerms:
term = 1 / (n¬≥)
partialSum += term
```

The convergence is visualized by:
- Plotting partial sums vs. term number
- Showing the target line at Œ∂(3) = 1.202056903...
- Calculating error and convergence statistics
- Displaying individual terms as bars

### Key Functions

- `animateConvergence()`: Main animation loop that adds terms and updates visualizations
- `drawConvergence()`: Renders the convergence curve with target line
- `drawTerms()`: Creates bar chart visualizations of individual terms
- `updateStats()`: Calculates and displays real-time statistics
- `updateSeriesDisplay()`: Shows the actual computed terms

## Usage

1. **Open the HTML file** in any modern web browser
2. **Adjust controls**:
   - Animation Speed: Controls how fast terms are added
   - Max Terms: Sets the maximum number of terms to compute
   - Display Mode: Choose how to visualize the series
   - Scale: Switch between linear and logarithmic scaling
3. **Watch the convergence** as the partial sums approach Œ∂(3)
4. **Reset the animation** to start over with different parameters
5. **Explore the educational content** to learn about the mathematical mystery

## Mathematical Significance

Œ∂(3) is significant because:

- **It's irrational** (proven by Roger Ap√©ry in 1978)
- **It appears in quantum field theory** and particle physics
- **It's related to prime number distribution**
- **Its exact nature remains unknown** - whether it's algebraic or transcendental
- **It's one of the few zeta function values** that we can compute but don't fully understand
